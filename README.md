This repository has 5 folders. The README.md file contains all of the information someone would need to replicate our project. The LICENSE file talks about the licensing and how to cite our project. The Scripts folder contains the code to show how we got our results. The Data file tells you about the data, as well as contains the CSV file for our data. Lastly, the output file shows the output of our VARIMAX and XGBoost models. 

# Section 1
We used Google Colab (Python) for this project. The packages we installed to use our code were pandas, _____________. Our project was performed on Windows laptops.

1. The first step to reproduce our project is to download the data. The csv file is in the Data folder, "Table.01.01.csv"
2. Navigate to the Predicting_FF_Cons/Prod.ipynb in the Scripts folder. Open our notebook in Google Colab. Uplaod the downloaded csv file to your Google Colab environment so it is availble while running the notebook.
3. Run the notebook: execute initial cells in order for preliminary data processing. These cells will load the dataset into a dataframe, select and rename relevant columns, and converting the date column to a datetime data type.
4. Reproduce the exploratory data analysis by running the EDA cells. These will produce a line chart depicting the RE and Fossil Fuel Consumption and Production over time and a boxplot showing the distribtuions (and different scales) for the 4 variables.
5. After EDA, we trained and tested
